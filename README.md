Hello! I'm Rafael Keller Tesser, a post-doctoral researcher at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp, Brazil), being a member of CCES and of the LMCAD research group. My current research topic involves high performance computing, cloud computing, and OS-level virtualization (AKA, containers).

I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Post-Graduate Program in Computer Science (PPGC) from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), in Brazil. My doctorate in the field of parallel and distributed programming touched upon several topics related to load balancing, parallel programming, modeling and simulation of parallel systems and applications. This doctorate included a collaboration with the Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble (LIG), in France. This included a sandwich doctorate internship at LIG, from June 2015 to April 2016. Previously, I obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science (2011), also from PPGC/UFRGS, and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (2007) from the Federal Universisty of Santa Maria (UFSM).

I have experience in Computer Science, with emphasis in Parallel and Distributed Computing, having worked in the following topics: parallel computing, load balancing, performance analysis, simulation of parallel systems, modeling and simulation of parallel applications, monitoring and instrumentation of parallel applications and of distributed systems.
